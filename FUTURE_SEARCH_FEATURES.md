// Future Search Feature Enhancements
// ===================================

// 1. SEARCH SUGGESTIONS (for empty query state)
// When user opens search page with no query (/search), show:
// - "Try searching for: Chicken, Rice, Pasta, Vegetarian recipes..."
// - Popular search terms based on most common ingredients/products
// - Category-based suggestions (Main Dishes, Desserts, Beverages, etc.)

// Implementation Notes:
// - Add to SearchResults.jsx in the "Browse all items" section
// - Create a suggestions array with popular terms
// - Style as clickable pills/chips that trigger searches
// - Could be based on actual search analytics or predefined

// 2. MOBILE RESPONSIVE IMPROVEMENTS
// Current responsive design is basic, could enhance:
// - Better card sizing on smaller screens
// - Touch-friendly interactions
// - Swipe gestures for view more
// - Mobile-specific search UX improvements

// 3. ADVANCED SEARCH FEATURES
// - Filter by category, price range, cooking time
// - Sort options (A-Z, price, popularity)
// - Search within results
// - Recently viewed items section

// Remember: These are lower priority until main features are stable!
